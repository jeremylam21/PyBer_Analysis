# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

This new analysis had two parts: 
The first was to find measures such as the total drivers by city, total rides by city, total fares by city, average fares 
per ride and average fare per driver via 2 different CSVs, which were merged into a single DataFrame. After these 
measures were found we could place them into a formatted, summary DataFrame that could cleanly present the information. 
The second was to change the original dataframe so that it was indexed by date and time. By doing this we were able to 
show the total fares for each city type over a period of time as shown below:
